# Samsung S6SY761 Touchscreen Controller Driver for Windows
In this repository you can find the S6SY761 controller driver for Windows (KMDF).
This driver has been only tested with S6SY761 controller found in OnePlus 7 Pro and 7T Pro.

This repository has been forked from https://github.com/edk2-porting/nt36xxx_win for the base and modified to work with S6SY761 digitizers.

## Disclaimer
This driver is not finished.
It contains debug code and might be missing comments as well.
Tracing has been replaced with KdPrintEx for various reason making development easier on some versions of Windows.

Have fun =)
